# CompIntel Update — 2026-02-17

## Foundational rebuild completed (NOT a daily pass)
Scope completed from scratch for:
- Balyasny (BAM)
- Citadel
- Point72

Method:
- Rebuilt dossiers inception-to-present using attributable permitted sources.
- Prioritized SEC/IAPD/Form ADV Item 5.F RAUM first for each adviser entity.
- Separated independently verifiable metrics (SEC/IAPD/Reuters) vs self-reported metrics (firm websites).
- Deduped to one canonical mention per fact per dossier.

Files overwritten:
- `dossiers/Balyasny (BAM).md`
- `dossiers/Citadel.md`
- `dossiers/Point72.md`

## Key net-new takeaways by firm

- **AI framing upgrade**: Reuters-sourced 2025 CIO commentary on AI upside/downside tail-risk scenarioing added under AI/Tech + risk outlook.
- **Tech leadership build-out noted**: recent head-of-investment-technology hire retained as medium-confidence external update.

### Citadel
- **Regulatory baseline anchored**: CITADEL ADVISORS LLC (CRD 148826) Item 5.F RAUM captured with exact filing timestamp and account count.
- **AI deployment evidence strengthened**: Reuters report on internal Citadel AI Assistant rollout to equities investors added with source-level detail.

## Dossier structural upgrade (2026-02-17, late run)
- Added a standardized **Developments (scannable, deduped)** block to all three target dossiers: BAM, Citadel, Point72.
- Each dossier now includes 12 explicit subsections:
  1) People moves
  2) New businesses / strategy launches
  3) Geographic / platform expansion
  4) Acquisitions
  5) Capital allocation
  6) Fund launch(es)
  7) Fund shutdowns / wind-downs
  8) Fundraising
  9) Market insights / commentary
  10) Partnerships
  11) Performance
  12) Regulatory
- Where no credible update was found, subsection explicitly states: **“No attributable material updates identified.”**

### Top additions by firm
- **BAM:** Added people-move cluster (Reuters BAM↔Citadel PM hiring; eFinancialCareers investment-tech leadership hire), AI tail-risk commentary (Reuters), and latest ADV regulatory marker.
