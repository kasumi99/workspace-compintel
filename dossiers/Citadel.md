# Citadel — Competitive Dossier

## Provenance rules (required)

For each non-trivial claim include:
- Source: {publisher/system}
- Reference: {URL or internal:<system/doc>}
- Date: {event date OR "as of" date; if unknown use access date}
- Source type: public | licensed/paywalled | internal/authorized | recruiter/hearsay
- Confidence: high | medium | low
- Tag (required when relevant): self-reported | independently verifiable | unconfirmed

### Confidence definition
Confidence measures: "Does the cited source clearly support this statement?"

Set:
- Confidence: high  → source explicitly states the claim (direct support)
- Confidence: medium → source is indirect/ambiguous, partial support, or interpretation required
- Confidence: low → rumor/hearsay OR missing source OR source not yet retrieved

Rule:
- Use high whenever the cited source explicitly states the claim.
- Use medium/low only when support is indirect/ambiguous or missing.

### Tag rules
- Tag: self-reported → firm-claimed metrics/claims (AUM, investment capital, headcount/professional counts, marketing claims)
- Tag: independently verifiable → widely corroborated across credible external sources
- Tag: unconfirmed → plausible but not yet corroborated sufficiently

Rule of thumb:
- If Citadel states "we have $X AUM/investment capital/headcount", use Confidence: high + Tag: self-reported.
- Do not downgrade confidence solely because a metric is self-reported.

### Safety + handling sensitive sources
- Do not speculate. If unknown, write “Unknown / Not confirmed”.
- Do not paste secrets/tokens or full confidential documents into this dossier.
  For internal sources, store a pointer only: internal:<system/doc>.
- Do NOT include leaked/stolen/NDA-breaching material or anything that appears to be MNPI.

### Output format rules
- For update bullets include: date, category, what changed, why it matters, source/date/reference, confidence (+ tag when relevant).
- For firm-claimed metrics, append: Confidence: high | Tag: self-reported.

### Output size rules
- Foundational build (first pass): be comprehensive; no hard bullet limits. Use subheadings and add “Key takeaways” at the top of long sections.
- Daily updates: keep “Recent updates” scannable; WhatsApp digest is capped separately.
