# Citadel — Competitive Dossier

## Provenance rules (required)

For each non-trivial claim include:
- Source: {publisher/system}
- Reference: {URL or internal:<system/doc>}
- Date: {event date OR "as of" date; if unknown use access date}
- Source type: public | licensed/paywalled | internal/authorized | recruiter/hearsay
- Confidence: high | medium | low
- Tag (optional but required when relevant): self-reported | independently verifiable | unconfirmed

### Confidence definition
Confidence measures: "Does the cited source clearly support this statement?"

Set:
- Confidence: high  → the source explicitly states it (direct support)
- Confidence: medium → source is indirect/ambiguous, partial support, or interpretation required
- Confidence: low → rumor/hearsay OR missing source OR source not yet retrieved

### Tag rules
- Tag: self-reported → metric/claim comes from the firm itself (AUM/investment capital/headcount stats, marketing claims)
- Tag: independently verifiable → widely corroborated across credible external sources
- Tag: unconfirmed → plausible but not yet corroborated sufficiently

Rule of thumb:
- If a firm website states "we have $X AUM", Confidence is HIGH (they said it), Tag is SELF-REPORTED.
- Do not downgrade to medium just because it's self-reported; use the tag.

### Safety + handling sensitive sources
- Do not speculate. If unknown, write “Unknown / Not confirmed”.
- Do not paste secrets/tokens or full confidential documents into this dossier.
  For internal sources, store a pointer only: internal:<system/doc>.
- Do NOT include leaked/stolen/NDA-breaching material or anything that appears to be MNPI.

### Output size rules
- Foundational build (first pass): be comprehensive; no hard bullet limits. Use subheadings and add “Key takeaways” at the top of long sections.
- Daily updates: keep “Recent updates” scannable; WhatsApp digest is capped separately.
